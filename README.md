This project contains various C++ implementations for common data structure tasks, such as Linear Search, Binary Search, Array Manipulation, and Sorting.

## Installation Guide

### How to Install the Code from GitHub

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open a terminal and use the following command to clone the project from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

2. **Navigate to the project folder: Change to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd repository-name

3. **Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed**:
For Windows, use MinGW or any other C++ compiler (like Visual Studio). For Linux or macOS, ensure g++ is installed.


## How to Run the Code with Windows Terminal

1. **Compile the code**:
   After cloning the repository, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to the project directory. Then, compile the C++ file with the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ -o lab lab.cpp

2. **Run the executable**:
  Once compiled, run the program using:


   ```bash
   .\lab.exe
  ```
The program will now run in the terminal, displaying a menu of options to perform operations such as inserting, deleting, or searching in the array.

## How to Run the Code Using an Online Compiler

### Open an Online Compiler:
Choose any of these online C++ compilers:

- [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)
- [Repl.it](https://replit.com/)
- [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/)

### Copy the Code:
